00:00:00,50-->00:00:04,00
Four days...nothing! Nothing!

2
00:00:06,00-->00:00:09,00
Not a single change in any cube, anywhere in the world!

3
00:00:09,50-->00:00:11,00
Four days and I am still in your lounge!

4
00:00:12,00-->00:00:13,00
You were the one who wanted to observe them

5
00:00:14,00-->00:00:14,80
Yes, well I thought they'd do something didn't I.

6
00:00:15,00-->00:00:17,50
Not just sit there while everyone eats endless cereal!

7
00:00:18,00-->00:00:20,00
You said we had to be patient.

8
00:00:21,00-->00:00:23,00
Yes, you, you! Not me! I hate being patient!

9
00:00:23,50-->00:00:24,50
Patience is for wimps!

10
00:00:28,00-->00:00:29,50
I can't live like this. Don't make me. 

11
00:00:30,00-->00:00:31,00
I need to be busy.

12
00:00:31,50-->00:00:33,00
Fine! Be busy! We'll watch the cubes.
